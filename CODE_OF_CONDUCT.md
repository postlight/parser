# The Postlight Parser Code of Conduct

## Conduct

**Contact Postlight Parser moderators:** [mercury@postlight.com](mailto:mercury@postlight.com)

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
  sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
  age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

- Please avoid using racist, sexually explicit or otherwise hostile
  nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all.

- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.

- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a
  right answer.

- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including
  the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://bit.ly/2jCvEok); if you
  have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please
  read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes
  people in socially marginalized groups.

- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
  you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member,
  please contact one of the channel ops or any of the [Postlight Parser moderation team](mailto:mercury@postlight.com)
  immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about
  making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you
feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the [Postlight Parser moderation team](mailto:mercury@postlight.com).

1.  Remarks that violate the Postlight Parser standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful,
    oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but
    never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)

2.  Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
    conduct or not, are also not allowed.

3.  Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.

4.  If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of
    the communication channel to cool off.

5.  If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
    i.e., indefinitely excluded.

6.  Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first
    offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.

7.  If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
    up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints
    about bans in-channel are not allowed.

8.  Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a
    moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than
    others.

In the Postlight Parser community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other.
Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In
particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if
they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings,
and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be
defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even
if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there
was something you could've communicated better â€” remember that it's your responsibility
to make your fellow community members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we
are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology.
You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long
as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Postlight Parser venues; including GitHub
repositories under postlight/parser such as mercury-rs and other Postlight repositories
with a \*-parser or parser-\* naming convention; For other projects adopting the Postlight Parser
Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement.
If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly
mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy
so as to avoid confusion.
