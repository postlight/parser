          authorized its construction, the 400,000-square-foot building stands on a five-acre site on the National Mall, close to the Washington Monument. President Obama will speak at its opening dedication.</p>
        <p class="g-p">Appropriately for a public museum at the heart of Washington&#x2019;s cultural landscape, the museum&#x2019;s creators did not want to build a space for a black audience alone, but for all Americans. In the spirit of
          <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/47558">Langston Hughes&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;I, Too,&#x201D;</a>  their message is a powerful declaration: The African-American story is an American story, as central to the country&#x2019;s narrative as any other, and understanding black history and culture is essential to understanding
          American history and culture.</p>

        <p class="g-p">Unusually, the museum had to start from scratch without a collection. It ran an &#x201C;Antiques Roadshow&#x201D;-style project in 15 cities that encouraged people to give heirlooms from their closets and attics, and yielded some of the 40,000 objects the museum
          now holds. About 3,500 artifacts will be on display in the opening exhibitions, many of them treasures donated by ordinary people. </p>
        <p class="g-p">Here are a few of these donors, and a look at a new museum confronted with the task of capturing both the pain and the pride of America&#x2019;s past.</p>

        <p class="g-p">The museum decided to tell its story in part chronologically rather than thematically. This decision is written into the architecture itself, as visitors descend 70 feet below ground to begin the historical journey centuries ago with the trans-Atlantic
          slave trade.</p>
        <p class="g-p">The museum confronts head-on America&#x2019;s history of slavery and racial oppression. Yet, while memorializing suffering, the museum wants even the bleakest artifacts to have a positive message. As visitors face an auction block where slaves stood
          to be bought and sold, they can also imagine the strength slaves summoned to survive.</p>

          and discrimination that African-Americans experienced and highlight their fight to overcome segregation and bring about social change.</p>

                so that we could keep her legacy alive. The more I could find, the better story we could tell of Althea Gibson, of who she was, what she did. They [the Smithsonian] came to my office in South Orange, New Jersey, with gloves and they went
                through photographs, letters, her writings that I had, the tennis racquet and immediately walked over to a FedEx shipping store near my office and shipped what they could. Althea was an incredible bowler, golfer, tennis player. She was
                an all-around athlete.&#x201D;</p>
